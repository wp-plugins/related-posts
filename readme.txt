== Description ==

This WordPress plugin provides multiple options to show the via tags related posts of a post. It contains a sidebar widget that is only visible when viewing a single post and displays a list of posts that are related with the current post via the tags. The number of related posts to display can be configured. The posts are sorted by the number of matching tags and then by the post date. It is also possible to insert the list of related post in a post via a placeholder. You can also embedd the list of related post in template files to add it to the bottom of each post page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are Related Posts? =

Related Posts are an easy way to keep visitors on your site longer. This plugin is one of the best ones for WordPress as it enables you to exchange traffic with similar sites and bring new, sticky visitors to your site.
It also provides analytics to keep track of how much traffic it's generating.

= Can I customize the widget? =

Yes, you can easily switch between themes that we provided or simply change the CSS.

= Does this plugin use redirects and hurts SEO? =

No, we've taken extra measure to not affect SEO or the speed of your site. :)
